# Installation

To download the development version of **sotu**:

Download the [zip ball](https://github.com/trinker/sotu/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/trinker/sotu/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **pacman** package to install the development version:

```r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/sotu")
```

# Demonstration

This section demonstrates some analysis that can be conducted with the data set.


## Load Packages and Data

```{r}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh(
    "trinker/textshape", 
    "trinker/gofastr", 
    "trinker/termco",    
    "trinker/hclustext"
)
pacman::p_load(sotu, dplyr, textshape, ggplot2, tidyr, magrittr)

data(sotu)
```


## Life Spans

Initially, when I started looking at the data set I was interested in the ages of Presidents.  I was amazed at the ages that early presidents lived too.  My wife, Cheryl, suggested I look at this in the context of when the presidents took office.  This plot shows the span from inauguration (red dot) to death (black dot) as a gray segment.  I can't make any conclusions but it is interesting that many of the mid-section Presidents took office later and lived shorter.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8.5}
sotu %>%
    select(President, Start, Died, Born) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    mutate(
        Years = Died - Born,
        Age = Start - Born
    ) %>%
    mutate(President = factor(President, levels=rev(President))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(y=President)) +
        geom_segment(aes(x = Age, xend = Years, yend = President), size=4, alpha=.3) +
        geom_point(aes(x=Years), size=5) +
        geom_point(aes(x=Age), color="red", size=5) 
```


## Long or Early Presidency Kills?

Cheryl also suggested that the duration of Presidency may effect the age a President lives to.  Here I investigated the link between inauguration and death age.  I have used a scatterplot and a crude model to investigate this question.   The plot doesn't appear to show any trends.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
sotu %>%
    select(President, Start, Died, End, Born) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    mutate(
        YTP = Died - Born,
        Age = Start - Born,
        Years = End-Start
    ) %>%
    group_by(President) %>%
    summarize(YTP = min(YTP), Age = min(Age), Years=sum(Years)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, Years, size=YTP)) +
        geom_smooth() +
        geom_point() 
```
  
Interestingly, the linear model indicates tat the inaugural age of the President has a significant positive effect on death age.  Years of presidency has a non-significant negative effect on death age.
  
```{r, warning=FALSE}
sotu %>%
    select(President, Start, Died, End, Born) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    mutate(
        YTP = Died - Born,
        Age = Start - Born,
        Years = End-Start
    ) %>%
    group_by(President) %>%
    summarize(YTP = min(YTP), Age = min(Age), Years=sum(Years)) %>%
    with(lm(Age ~ YTP + Years)) %T>% 
        {print(summary(.))} %>%
        anova()
```
